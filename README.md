# SplatJS

A 2d HTML5 Canvas game engine

SplatJS is a 2d game engine made for creating multi-platform games entirely in JavaScript.

# Features

* Rectangles!
* Keyboard, mouse, and touch input
* Sounds and music (Web Audio API and HTML5 Audio)
* Sprite animation
* Asset loading, and built-in loading screen
* Games work well on phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.
* A\* Pathfinding

# Supported Platforms

* Chrome (desktop & mobile)
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer (desktop & mobile)
* Safari (desktop & mobile)
* iOS using [Ejecta](http://impactjs.com/ejecta)
* Chrome Web Store

SplatJS works in PhoneGap/Cordova, but it seems like the apps it produces lack hardware acceleration, making games unplayable.

# Download a standalone SplatJS:

* 1.3.0 [uncompressed](https://splatjs.github.io/download/splat-1.3.0.js) - [minified](https://splatjs.github.io/download/splat-1.3.0.min.js)

# Install through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org)

```
$ npm install --save splatjs
```
Then require SplatJS into your game:
```
var Splat = require("splat");
```
Then use [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to bundle your game as a single JavaScript file for the browser.
